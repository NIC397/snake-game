# snake-game

## Description

This is an exciting variation of the classic Snake game, implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. In this version, you control a snake that must eat numbered food items while avoiding a pursuing monster.

## Features

- **Unique Gameplay**: Eat numbered food items to grow longer, but beware of the monster chasing you!
- **Scoring System**: Each food item has a number (1-9) that determines how much your snake grows when eaten.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The snake moves slower when it's growing, adding a strategic element to the game.
- **Time Challenge**: A timer keeps track of how long you've been playing.
- **Contact Counter**: Tracks how many times the monster touches your snake's tail.

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Control the snake's direction
- **Spacebar**: Pause/Resume the motion of your snake

## Objective

Eat all the food items before the monster catches you. You win if your snake reaches a length of 50!

## Game Elements

- **Snake**: Controlled by the player, grows longer as it eats.
- **Monster**: Pursues the snake, trying to catch it.
